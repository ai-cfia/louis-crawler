<h3>1. What is the new licensing system under the SFCR?</h3></summary>

<p>Now that the SFCR has come into force, the CFIA has introduced a new online licensing system. Food businesses can apply online for 1 or more Safe Food for Canadians licences (SFC licences) to conduct specific activities relating to <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a80">food</a>, such as importing, manufacturing, processing, treating or packaging. This licensing system replaces the former process for registering establishments as of <span class="nowrap">January 15<sup>th</sup> 2019</span>.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>2. Why is the CFIA introducing the new licensing system?</h3></summary>

<p>The new licensing system:</p>

<ul>
<li>provides a consistent and universal means to identify who is involved in the production and supply of food in Canada, a key activity in maintaining food safety</li>
<li>recognizes that not all food businesses are alike, and allows them to structure their licences to fit their unique needs</li>
<li>aligns Canada's model with internationally accepted best practices for food safety and globally recognized <i lang="la">Codex Alimentarius</i> food standards</li>
<li>demonstrates the CFIA's commitment to service and digital-first tools</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>3. What has happened to my previous licence or registration now that the regulations are in effect?</h3></summary>

<p>If you currently hold a registration or licence (permission) issued under the <i>Canada Agricultural Products Act</i>, <i>Fish Inspection Act</i>, or <i>Meat Inspection Act</i>, it will remain valid until it expires - provided there is a statement on it, or on your renewal letter, indicating it is also a licence issued under the <i>Safe Food for Canadians Act</i>. As expiration approaches, you are required to apply for a <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a102">licence</a> under the SFCR. You may add your previous registration/licence number in your enrolment profile. It will be used as your unique establishment identifier (where applicable) and continue to be used for export purposes to maintain continuity.</p>

<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>4. I am not sure if my business needs an SFC licence; where can I find this information?</h3></summary>

<p>For information that will help you understand if the licensing requirements apply to your food business, refer to the various resources on the <a href="/food-licences/eng/1523876882572/1523876882884">Licensing</a> web page, including the <a href="https://ca1se.voxco.com/SE/93/SFCR_licence/?&lang=en">Licensing interactive tool</a> as well as the <a href="/food-licences/food-business-activities/eng/1524074697160/1524074697425">Food business activities that require a license under the SFCR</a>.</p>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>5. When will I need an SFC licence and how do I apply?</h3></summary>

<p>For information on when you need to comply with licensing requirements, refer to the <a href="/food-safety-for-industry/timelines/eng/1528199762125/1528199763186">SFCR Timelines</a> web page. Dates vary by food and activity so it is important to review the appropriate timetable for your sector.</p>

<p>Registrations and/or licences renewed before <span class="nowrap">January 15<sup>th</sup> 2019</span> remain valid until expiry provided there is a statement on it, or on your renewal letter, indicating that it is also a licence under the <i>Safe Food for Canadians Act</i>. That licence will be considered valid for any other food commodity prepared within that establishment.</p>

<p>If your business does not have an existing CFIA licence or registration and the <a href="/food-safety-for-industry/timelines/eng/1528199762125/1528199763186">SFCR Timelines</a> indicate that you need an SFC licence as of <span class="nowrap">January 15, 2019</span> to continue operations, you should start by enrolling in <a href="/about-cfia/my-cfia/eng/1482204298243/1482204318353">My CFIA</a> and create your account and business profile. Applications for a new SFC licence are available through the My CFIA portal. The guidance document <a href="/about-cfia/my-cfia/before-you-sign-up/eng/1539706469438/1539706470034">Before you sign up for My CFIA</a> will help you with the process.</p>

<p>Note that before you apply for a licence, you have to meet the requirements of Part 4 of the SFCR that apply to your food business. These relate to preventive controls, maintenance and operation of an establishment and preventive control plans. For more information, refer to <a href="/eng/1524581767630/1524581834894?chap=0">Regulatory requirements: Preventive controls</a> and <a href="/preventive-controls/preventive-control-plans/regulatory-requirements/eng/1526502822129/1526502868878">Regulatory requirements: Preventive control plan</a>.</p>

<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>6. Can I get an SFC licence before the CFIA inspects my establishment?</h3></summary>

<p>In certain cases, yes, it is not expected that all establishments will be inspected before receiving a licence from the CFIA. The CFIA uses a risk-based approach to inspection which means that a variety of risk factors will be used to prioritize and manage inspection activities. The CFIA may also have to inspect licence holders requesting an export certificate, regardless of their risk profile, if it is a requirement of the importing country.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>7. Can I conduct an activity that requires an SFC licence but is not indicated on my licence application?</h3></summary>


<p>No. You can only conduct an activity that it is identified in your licence application. The licence can be amended to include new activities, if needed. If the activity does not require a licence under the <a href="/english/reg/jredirect2.shtml?safefood">SFCA</a> then it does not need to be included in your application.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>8. I have a produce licence issued under the <i>Licensing and Arbitration Regulations</i>. What will happen to it now that the SFCR is in force?</h3></summary>

<p>Licences issued under the <i>Licensing and Arbitration Regulations</i> are not carried over under the SFCR. Instead, a membership with the <a href="http://fvdrc.com/">Fruit and Vegetable Dispute Resolution Corporation</a> (DRC) is required. The DRC is a non-profit organization that provides dispute resolution, consultation, mediation and arbitration for the produce trade.</p>

<h3>9. What is the difference between a Safe Food for Canadians licence and a Dispute Resolution Corporation (DRC) membership?</h3></summary>

<p>An SFC licence is different from a DRC membership. An SFC licence identifies businesses and authorizes them to perform licensable activities. A DRC membership supports fair and ethical trading practices by facilitating effective trade dispute resolution, thereby minimizing trade irritants.</p>

<h3>10. I import fresh fruits. Do I need to have an SFC licence and be a member of the DRC?</h3></summary>

<p>Yes, in order to import fresh fruits you need an SFC import licence and a DRC membership.</p>

<h3>11. If I am sending food across provincial or territorial boundaries for business purposes, is it my responsibility to ensure that I acquired the food from an SFC licence holder?</h3></summary>

<p>Yes. A person who sends food across provincial and/or territorial borders is responsible to ensure that it was manufactured, processed, treated, preserved, graded, packaged, and labelled by a <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a103">licence holder</a> and that it meets SFCR requirements. An exception exists in the case of field packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables. Field packers do not require a licence as long as the fresh fruit or vegetable will be further processed in another province by a licence holder.</p>

<h3>12. I already had a certificate of registration issued under the <i>Fish Inspection Regulations</i> that was in an inactive status when the SFCR came into force. Do I have to request re-activation now that the SFCR is in force?</h3></summary>

<p>No, if your certificate of registration had not expired when the SFCR came into force, it was automatically transitioned to an SFC licence. The ability to inactivate/reactivate a licence is not an option in the SFCR licensing system. This means that you now have an SFC licence that is active and you have to comply with the SFCR requirements as of <span class="nowrap">January 15, 2019</span>.</p>

<p>It is important that you identify, in your preventive control plan, the hazards that can be present because of a period of inactivity, particularly where incompatible activities may be conducted during this time. These are the hazards that present a risk of contamination to the food you prepare following this period (for interprovincial trade or export). You must also describe the control measures you apply to prevent, eliminate or reduce these hazards to an acceptable level.</p>

<p>For more information refer to section 5.17 Seasonal food businesses in the guidance document <a href="/food-licences/food-business-activities/eng/1524074697160/1524074697425">Food business activities that require a licence under the <i>Safe Food for Canadians Regulations</i></a>.</p>

<h3>13. I manufacture food in the US and export it to Canada. Do I need to apply for an SFC licence?</h3>
</summary>


<p>You do not need a licence to prepare food for export to Canada. Only the person importing the food in Canada requires a licence to import under the <i>Safe Food for Canadians Regulations</i> (SFCR) and is responsible for meeting the other requirements of the SFCR. This includes having a PCP and meeting traceability requirements. The importer could be located in Canada or in the US.</p>

<p>The US is a country recognized by the CFIA as having a food safety system that provides the same level of protection as Canada's regulatory system. As per Subsection 12(1) of the SFCR, if the person importing the food is a <a href="/importing-food-plants-or-animals/food-imports/nri/eng/1539874432061/1539874432404">non-resident importer</a> (NRI) with a fixed place of business in the US, they are eligible to hold an import licence. In this case, the US business needs to meet the same requirements as Canadian importers, including:</p>


<ul>
<li>having a licence to import</li>
<li>having a preventive control plan</li>
<li>maintaining procedures and processes for handling and investigating complaints and recalls</li>
<li>keeping clear and complete traceability records that show who the food was obtained from and to whom it was sent</li>

<h3>2. What are the changes to the fees in addition to an SFC licence?</h3></summary>

<p>In an effort to keep costs stable for businesses, minimal changes have been made to CFIA fees.

Please refer to <a href="/eng/1530134673372/1530134725024">CFIA's Fees Notice</a> for current fee amounts.

<h3>3. Why are the charges for registration changing to charges for establishment inspection?</h3></summary>

<p>With the introduction of a common licensing regime through the <i>Safe Food for Canadians Act</i> and <i>Regulations</i>, the CFIA is no longer registering establishments. Current charges for registration are linked to the volume of production (for example registrations for a dairy establishment) or product processed (registrations for a fish and seafood processing establishment) to reflect the level of inspection conducted by the CFIA. As a result, the CFIA has converted registration fees to establishment inspection fees. Establishment inspection fees currently exist for some commodities (for example eggs and meat), and this approach brings some consistency to the Fees Notice.</p>

<p><a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a18">Preventive controls</a> refer to a combination of measures that form a system focused on: prevention to control risks to food safety, consumer protection and animal welfare during slaughter activities. They are based on the internationally accepted <a href="http://www.fao.org/input/download/standards/23/CXP_001e.pdf"><i lang="la">Codex Alimentarius</i> General Principles of Food Hygiene CAC/RCP 1-1969 - PDF (234 kb)</a> and the recommendations outlined in the <a href="http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&amp;L=0&amp;htmfile=chapitre_aw_slaughter.htm">World Organisation for Animal Health's Terrestrial Animal Health Code&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Slaughter of Animals</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a19">preventive control plan (PCP)</a> is a <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a70"><strong>written document</strong></a> prepared, kept, maintained and implemented by a food business. It describes how hazards to a food are controlled as well as how the requirements for the humane treatment of food animals during <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a157">slaughter activities</a> and the requirements related to consumer protection (such as labelling, packaging, grading) are met.</p>

This is often referred to as validation. There are a range of approaches that can be used to obtain such evidence so that you can be confident you are using validated measures. The type and depth of information needed to demonstrate effectiveness depends on the type of control measure.</p>

<p>The process for obtaining evidence on the effectiveness of a control measure requires that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>know your food, the hazards and control measures</li>

<p>Generally, wholesalers or distributors who buy and sell food within Canada (not importers) and trade food across provincial or territorial boundaries are required to trace the food they sell 1 step back and 1 step forward in the supply chain.</p>
<p>The sale of food directly to consumers is considered <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a147">retail</a> sale, therefore wholesalers and distributors who sell food directly to consumers are required to trace the food they sell 1 step back.

<p>The traceability requirements apply to retail businesses such as supermarkets, grocery stores, bakeries and butcheries. This includes supermarkets that have some food service activities, such as salad bars, self-serve, single-serve items and meals-to-go within the store.</p>
<p>The traceability requirements do not apply to food service operations such as restaurants, buffets, cafeterias, fast food restaurants, caterers, food trucks and coffee shops. This includes food service operations that have some supermarket-style activities, such as restaurants and coffee shops that also sell prepackaged foods on-site, whether prepared on- or off-site.

<h3>5. How do the traceability requirements apply to businesses that use cross-docking as a way to provide food to another person or business?</h3></summary>

<p>In general, &quot;cross-docking&quot; refers to the process of transferring food from an incoming vehicle directly onto an outbound vehicle. Cross docking typically takes place at a distribution center or warehouse, however there is no storage of the food at this location. The distribution center or warehouse does not enter this food into their inventory system.</p>
<p>If the food is <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a45">provided</a> to a warehouse and the warehouse provides that food to another person in a different province, the warehouse is required to trace the food 1 step forward and 1 step back. However, if the food is simply transferred at a warehouse location, directly from 1 truck to another, as in cross-docking, the warehouse is not required to trace the food. The traceability requirements apply to the food business that is providing the food and the food business that is receiving that food.</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>6. Do the traceability requirements differ based on my business model, for example franchises versus corporations?</h3></summary>

<p>No, traceability requirements apply consistently across business models. The requirements are based on the <strong>activity</strong> you conduct. In general, traceability requirements apply to most food businesses that:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Import food</li>
 <li>Export food</li>
 <li>Distribute or trade food across provincial borders</li>
 <li>Make food for interprovincial trade or export</li>
 <li>Sell food to consumers at retail (not required to trace forward to consumers, only to track the incoming food they sell 1 step back)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in the 2 scenarios below a distribution center who provides food to a grocery store in another province is required to trace the food 1 step forward and 1 step back regardless of the business model they follow:</p>
<ol>
 <li>A distribution center and grocery store that operate under the same ownership</li>
 <li>A distribution center and independently owned franchise grocery store under different ownership</li>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
 <h3>7. a) The traceability requirements indicate that I must identify my food using a lot code or unique identifier that enables the food to be traced; what is the difference between these terms?</h3></summary>

<p>A <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a168">unique identifier</a> refers to a code that you use to identify a defined quantity of <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a80">food</a> to allow it to be traced. Unique identifiers may include a lot code, best before date, purchase order number or bill of lading number.</p>
<p>A <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a104">lot code</a> refers to a type of code that you use to identify a quantity of food that was manufactured, prepared, produced, stored, graded, packaged or labelled under the same conditions. It can contain numbers, letters or both numbers and letters.</p>
<p>A Universal Product Code (UPC) or Price Look-Up (PLU) code is not considered a unique identifier since it does not identify a defined quantity of a food that is provided to another person.</p>
</details>


<details>
 <summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>7. b) Does the lot code have to be declared on the outside of a shipping container that contains consumer prepackaged food individually labelled with a lot code?</h3></summary>

<p>The lot code can be applied, attached or accompany the food. Since the lot code is on each individual consumer prepackaged product it does not need to be on the shipping container.</p>

<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>8. a) As it pertains to traceability-specific labelling requirements can I use a 'growing region' as an acceptable option for complying with the lot code labelling of consumer prepackaged fresh fruits or vegetables?</h3></summary>


<p>'Growing region' can be used as the <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a104">lot code</a> for <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a63">consumer prepackaged</a> fresh fruits or vegetables (FFV). A growing region could be a province/state or a sub-provincial/state where the FFV were grown. However, the growing region cannot be the country of origin. If a province or state is already included in the name and principal place of business, this would comply with the lot code labelling requirement as long as it is truly the province/state where the FFV were grown.</p>
<p>A more specific lot code – for example GPS coordinates, grower ID, establishment or SFC licence number – will help ensure a more timely removal of affected product during a food safety investigation or recall. This may limit the impact of a recall by excluding product not implicated in the event.</p>

 <h3>8. b) If a company decides to use growing region as a lot code on a consumer prepackaged fresh fruit or vegetable (FFV), how should this information be declared on the label? Can it appear on the bottom of the package?</h3></summary>
<p>The growing region, when used as the <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a104">lot code</a>, must comply with Section 208 (legibility) of the <i>Safe Foods for Canadians Regulations</i> (SFCR) and could appear on the bottom of the package. However, if the growing region is used in combination with an existing labelling requirement, for example, "name and principal place of business", the applicable labelling regulations for that requirement still apply.

<h3>1. How does the <i>Safe Food for Canadians Regulations</i> (SFCR) apply to exporters?</h3></summary>

<p>An exporter can only <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a34">export</a> food that was manufactured, processed, treated, preserved, graded, packaged, labelled or slaughtered by a <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a103">licence holder</a>.</p>

<p>When there are no requirements in place in the foreign country, exported foods are required to meet the food safety requirements of the SFCR.</p>

<p>Generally, a person is permitted to export a <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a80">food</a> that does not meet Canadian requirements–as long as the provisions in section 16(1) of the SFCR are met. These requirements must always be met and relate to <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a26">traceability</a>, animal welfare, humane treatment of animals, preventive control plans, and workshift agreements. You are required to keep written documents that substantiate the foreign requirements have been met and your food must be clearly labelled for export.</p>

<p>Foods previously regulated solely under the <i><a href="/english/reg/jredirect2.shtml?drgr">Food and Drug Regulations</a></i> (FDR) that were not eligible to receive export certificates from the CFIA may now be eligible for certification under the SFCR.</p>

<p>If you need an export certificate from the CFIA, you need to have a Safe Food for Canadians (SFC) <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a102">licence</a> and a written <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a19">preventive control plan</a>, even if the food you are exporting is exempt from these requirements.</p>

<h3>2. Our company has multiple establishments within our business; do I need multiple licences or 1 for all of them?</h3></summary>

<p>Licence numbers on the export certificate, establishment eligibility list, and inspection legend (if applicable) need to be the same for the purpose of certification and when the shipment reaches the importing country's borders.

<p>One SFC licence for multiple establishments may not meet the requirements of foreign trading partners (for example, China and the European Union) as some countries require each establishment/location to have a unique identification number.</p>

<h3 id="a5i">Meat brokers and meat traders</h3>

<p>The CFIA will maintain the status quo for meat export processes to maintain market access and prevent negative impacts on existing trade relations. In future, the CFIA will be reviewing export certification processes, and will consult with all stakeholders including foreign competent authorities during any review of certification processes before making any changes.</p>
<p>The CFIA requires applications for meat export certificates to come from the licensed <a href="h/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a113">operator</a> of the registered establishment. To clarify with SFCR terminology, the CFIA will continue to issue certificates following current processes under SFCR to the licensed food business conducting activities related to preparing for export at a domestic <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a7">establishment</a>.

<h3>14. What are the controls I need just for export?</h3></summary>

<p>To summarize, if you are producing the food, you need to maintain a record of the foreign country requirements that you are meeting (if different than Canadian requirements), and keep a record of the product specification and <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a104">lot code</a> or other <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a168">unique identifier</a> as part of your <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a26">traceability</a> requirements. If the food does not meet Canadian requirements, the product also needs to be labelled with the word "export" to ensure it doesn't end up in the Canadian marketplace.</p>

<p>If you are exporting the food, regardless if you manufactured the food or not, you are also responsible for ensuring that: the food was manufactured by a <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a103">licence holder</a>; the food meets the foreign country requirements, and the manufacturer and/or exporter (as applicable) is on the export eligibility list for a particular country. You also need to ensure you have controls and records relating to the export certificates or other permissions (as applicable) for your shipments.</p>

<p>Some countries require export certificates for food imported into their country. Often, export eligibility lists are used as a type of CFIA permission that verifies that the food is manufactured at a food business under a food safety program and under the CFIA's oversight. If an exporter, in addition to the manufacturer, is required to be on an export eligibility list for a particular country/commodity, then they both would need a licence and a PCP.</p>

<h3>17. Am I still able to receive a Manufacturer's Declaration form under the SFCR?</h3>
</summary>
<p>The Manufacturer's Declaration Form (CFIA/ACIA 5280) has been phased out under the SFCR. Products previously only eligible to receive the Manufacturer's Declaration Form may be certified by a <a href="/exporting-food-plants-or-animals/food-exports/certification/certificate-of-free-sale/eng/1507732648572/1507732649258">Certificate of Free Sale (CFIA/ACIA 5786)</a> provided the exporter has a <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a102">licence</a> and a <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a19">preventive control plan (PCP)</a>. There may be a fee for this certificate under the new user fees associated with the SFCR.

<h3>18. Why is the Manufacturer's Declaration Form (CFIA/ACIA 5280) not being issued after January 15, 2019?</h3>
</summary>
<p>The Manufacturer's Declaration Form (CFIA/ACIA 5280) is not an export certificate and was developed with the intent to support the non-federally registered food sector (NFRS) where CFIA did not have the authority to certify food exports under the <a href="/english/reg/jredirect2.shtml?drga">Food and Drugs Act</a> (FDA) and <a href="/english/reg/jredirect2.shtml?drgr">Regulations</a> (FDR).</p>
<p>The new <a href="/english/reg/jredirect2.shtml?sfcrrsac">SFCR</a> provides the CFIA with authority to issue export certificates for all foods when a certificate is required by the importing country.<br>
 Effective January 15, 2019, the Manufacturer's Declaration Form (CFIA/ACIA 5280) will be replaced by the Certificate of Free Sale (CFIA/ACIA 5786) when a certificate or commercial document is required for export. This certificate will only be issued to food companies licensed under the <i>Safe Food for Canadians Regulations</i> (SFCR).</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>19. What is a Certificate of Free Sale?</h3>
</summary>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) form for the Certificate of Free Sale (CFIA/ACIA 5786) is available for food products manufactured by licensed parties under the <em>Safe Food for Canadians Act</em> (SFCA) and SFCR. A Certificate of Free Sale is issued by the CFIA to meet an importing country's requirements when a certificate or commercial document is required for exported food products. For more information, please visit <a href="/exporting-food-plants-or-animals/food-exports/certification/certificate-of-free-sale/eng/1507732648572/1507732649258">Certificate of Free Sale (CFIA/ACIA 5786)</a>.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>20. What do I require to obtain a Certificate of Free Sale?</h3>
</summary>
<p>If you want to export your manufactured food products (products that were previously in the non-federally registered sector), and require a certificate of free sale, you must have a valid Safe Food for Canadians (SFC) <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a102">licence</a> to manufacture and/or export; and meet other SFCR requirements including a written <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a19">preventive control plan (PCP)</a>.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>21. What if a shipment is refused at the importing country's border?</h3>
</summary>
<p>Exporters should work with their local CFIA office when a shipment is refused at the importing country's border. Examples of reasons why a shipment would be refused could include, because of administrative errors on the certificate, or if the country does not recognize the Certificate of Free Sale (CFIA/ACIA 5786) for markets previously accepting the Manufacturer's Declaration Form (CFIA/ACIA 5280).</p>

<h3>22. Am I eligible to apply for a Certificate of Free Sale online?</h3>
</summary>
<p>Initially, applying for a Certificate of Free Sale online through <a href="/about-cfia/my-cfia/eng/1482204298243/1482204318353">My CFIA</a> will only be available to newly licensed food businesses under the SFCR for foods that fall in the manufactured foods category. These food businesses were not previously registered with the CFIA.</p>
<p>All previously registered food businesses should continue to apply for their export certificates through their local CFIA offices, until further notice.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>23. What are the benefits of applying for the Certificate of Free Sale online?</h3>
</summary>
<p>Your online application takes only minutes to complete, provided you already have a My CFIA account. As part of the online application process once you log into your My CFIA account, you will be taken through a series of questions that will determine the requirements. Once completed, you will be able to immediately download and print an electronically signed certificate from your dashboard.</p>
<p>There are even more benefits of using My CFIA - such as the ability to use copy, re-use, and template functions, which will allow you to re-submit frequently used applications for exported commodities, saving you time.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>24. Do I use the Certificate of Free Sale for all my food exports?</h3>
</summary>
<p>The <a href="/exporting-food-plants-or-animals/food-exports/certification/certificate-of-free-sale/eng/1507732648572/1507732649258">Certificate of Free Sale</a> should only be used if it is required by the importing country. This is the only certificate CFIA will issue for foods that fall in the manufactured food category; in other words, products that were previously in the non-federally registered sector.</p>
<p>The Certificate of Free Sale does not replace product-specific or commodity-specific certificates that have been negotiated with foreign countries. It also does not replace or preclude additional import requirements that may be established by the importing country. For any foods manufactured by a currently registered food business, the application for the Certificate of Free Sale or any other required export certificate must be made through local CFIA offices.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>25. Do I need to print the Certificate of Free Sale?</h3>
</summary>

<p>Yes, the Certificate of Free Sale must be printed so it can accompany your shipment and be provided to the importing country.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>26. How do I print my Certificate of Free Sale issued through My CFIA?</h3>
</summary>
<p>The certificate will be available for printing from your My CFIA account dashboard. Navigate to your issued certificate tab and select your certificate from the list. Under the export certificate documents, click and download your original export certificate. You will only be able to print the original certificate once, but you can print as many certified copies of the certificate as you need.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="well well-sm">
<h3>27. Can my shipment be accompanied with a certified copy of the Certificate of Free Sale or do I need the original certificate?</h3>
</summary>
<p>Your original Certificate of Free sale must be used as the official import document and must accompany your shipment. A certified copy can be forwarded as a duplicate to the importer, used for preclearance purposes and stored in your files.</p>

<h3>28. What if I am exporting food for personal use?</h3></summary>

<p>In order for exported food to be considered for personal use, the food that is being exported must not be more than the quantity set out in the document entitled <a href="/about-cfia/acts-and-regulations/list-of-acts-and-regulations/documents-incorporated-by-reference/personal-use-exemption/eng/1520439688578/1520439689098">Maximum Quantity Limits for Personal Use Exemption</a>, and must not be intended for commercial use. Please note that other countries have determined what they will accept without additional <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a34">export</a> controls. For example, the EU does not have an exemption for any <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a68">dairy products</a> entering the EU, even if they are for personal use. Please check with the country to confirm the <a href="/eng/1430250286859/1430250287405#a37">import</a> requirements before you plan to bring any type of food for personal consumption.</p>
